# What is Firebase Web3Connect?

Firebase Web3Connect is a library that allows you to connect your [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) project with Web3 wallets. It provides a simple and secure way to authenticate users with Web3 wallets and manage their connection state leveraging [Firebase Authentication services](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).

Firebase Web3Connect is non-custodial, meaning users retain control of their private keys and funds. It is compatible with popular Web3 wallets extensions like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io), [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), and more.

- **Gaming Platforms**: Enable users to connect their Web3 wallets to access in-game assets and rewards.
- **Social Networks**: Implement Web3 wallet sign-in to enable users to interact with decentralized social networks.
- **Content Platforms**: Authenticate users with Web3 wallets to access premium content and services.

## Developer Experience
